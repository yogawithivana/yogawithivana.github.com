<p>Some call sloths <em>the bodhisattva of the forest</em> because they have an inherent peaceful smile on their faces while hanging in the trees. This unique animal has evolved in direction of slowness instead of speed - their slowness is their survival strategy. Sloths have a very slow metabolism and little food keeps them going for days. They have very little muscle mass and are light enough to rest hanging from thin branches in the very tops of the trees where predators can hardly reach them.</p>

<p>According to Japanese anthropologist and environmental activist <a href="http://www.sloth.gr.jp/tsuji/koiwa.html">Keibo Oiwa</a> slowness is a beautiful skill we can learn from sloths. 'Slow is beautiful’ he says. 'In the modern world you have to go faster, so that the other person feels that he or she has to go faster too. Then you have to go faster again. We are actually stealing time from each other. After all, time is the only thing that belongs to us in this life. Life is time. We have been trying to be successful in this competitive world by sacrificing the only thing we have, which is time.’</p>

<p>But we can also reclaim and appreciate our time. We can embrace slowness.</p>

<p>Have a beautifully slow Christmas all!</p>

<p>Simply open your fingers</br>
Let the squashed little bird</br>
With ruffled feathers</br>
Fly out of your palm</br>
</br>
No need for clenching</br>
Just soften, release the fists</br>
We are not here to defeat the world</br>
But offer ourselves as a gift</br>
</br>
Open your hands with courage</br>
The whole universe pulsates</br>
In each of your trembling fingers</br>
Fragile and eager</br>
</br>
Just open to wonder</br>
Allow the tender petals to unfold</br>
And bloom effortlessly</br>
Through your fingertips</br></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been just watching <a href="http://anatomytrains.co.uk/?wpsc-product=bodyreading-101-visual-assessment">Tom Myers’s DVD training in bodyreadying</a> Have never really seen anyone explain the postural tilts and shifts so beautifully. Have never really seen anyone explain the postural tilts and shifts so beautifully.</p>

<p>Another thing I really liked is that he doesn’t just readjust the body as it ‘should be’ but explores where to get that extra little space for expansion.
In order to make an alignment shift sustainable, we need to focus on the body as a whole, looking not only for the areas of the body that have been overused and start to trouble us, but also the underused ones. We need to find an individual’s capacity to expand.</p>

<p>I’ve found my own extra little space upwards, discovering the simplicity and ease of rebounding from the earth and lengthening up through yoga. And I literally grew some 2–2.5 cm taller though already in my early thirties. The spine realigned itself, slightly decreasing its excessive curvature and getting some more length.</p>

<p>Our bodies are beautifully plastic and can adapt to our lifestyles and compensate for our postural habits in a variety of ways. Similarly they can gradually adopt a better alignment if we offer them space for expansion through movement, the space to grow into.</p>

<p>This makes me think of Chinese gardens. As opposed to Western tightly trimmed grass and perfectly symmetrical lanes of flowers, they focus on wild beauty of nature, creating the effect that ‘although made by mankind, it seemed created by God’. They don’t try to tame nature but work together with it, making space in which nature can grow of its own accord.</p>

<p class="centeredimage"><img src="http://yogawithivana.com/images/bamboo-garden.jpg" alt="photo of a bamboo garden"></img></a></p>


<p>We need to work together with the body and allow it to find a sustainable solution in realigning itself, rather than force it into a particular ‘healthy’ alignment. It’s not enough to consciously drop the ribs, untuck the pelvis, check yourself in the mirror and just keep checking if you are in alignment thousand times a day. The change needs to happen at subconscious level. As we make space for the body to realign itself, the change will feel natural and won’t need to be consciously maintained. The body will grow into a healthy alignment — in its own way, gradually finding its new normal.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I stumbled upon a dazzling quote of Roberto Bolaño <em>"In poetry, you become infinitely small without disappearing.”</em> And it reminded me how much I miss writing poems and that feeling of standing on the edge of unknown and leaving your self behind as you jump in.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I wrote anything so beautifully flowing and irrational that you can dare call it poetry. Starting with a vague idea, or not even that, just following a familiar tickle in my fingers, grabbing a pen and seeing where it all goes. Scribbling on napkins in cafes and back of public transport tickets. Writing as an exploration, listening carefully to the ripples of the deep, instinctive mind and trying to mirror it in words. Letting the story smoothly thread itself through my fingers.</p>

<p>Funny… I realised this morning teaching a small class that it’s this same feeling I sometimes have while teaching yoga - stepping on the mat without any idea what is going to happen, letting the class unfold gently by itself, simply diving in. Of course, when you realise there are for example too many hip openers, it’s useful to let the rational mind jump in with a counter sequence to balance it out. But sometimes the class can unfold itself effortlessly, without the need for much interference and you as a teacher can simply step back and allow yourself to become infinitely small. One of my great inspirations, Malaysian yoga teacher <a href="https://mengfoonglai.wordpress.com/">Meng Foong</a> beautifully explains it: "There is nobody. No students. No you… Just yoga."</p>
