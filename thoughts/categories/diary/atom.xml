    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The morning started with a moment of deep wordless gratitude, sitting in the living room under the pots of blooming flowers. Sitting quietly on the floor while sun gently shines through my eyelids. The room full of bright coloured cushions and soft things. A white cuddly toy cat patiently waiting for the tiny hand to touch and squeeze its soft cotton tail.</p>

<p>The tiny one is awake, cosily wriggling in his safe little house, gently pushing his round little bum through the skin of my upper belly. I sing for him softly and gently cuddle the little knee as it moves trough my skin.</p>

<p>Dain came early from work. Our little ritual of kissing for long time on the door, he with his cycling helmet on. Making a big colourful salad together and going for a walk under trees in Hackney Downs. The fragile young oak tree that we were watering is getting better now. Slowly growing fresh green leaves, whole bunches of them, some straight from its gentle trunk. I feel like everything is growing and blooming around and inside me, such a magical feeling.</p>

<p>I feel so grateful for living this life as it is, maybe not perfect, maybe I could have achieved more (my mum would certainly say so) but I'm happy following my path. Learning and growing. Giving and sharing. Letting the nature unfold the miracle of life through my body. Slowly spreading my branches and watching the buds emerging from the leaves and opening very slowly. Gentle flowers gradually turning into little green fruits that under the soft touch of sunshine slowly become redder, plumper and juicier, until the stems slowly break, obeying to the roundness and ripeness of this new life and setting it free.</p>
