    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Searching for Wisdom or Escaping the Information Overload?</h3>

<p>What is meditation? In one form or another and under different names it has been around for centuries in both East and West as part of various intellectual and religious practices. Meditation is growth, says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh">Osho</a>. It's going back to the universal human in ourselves – as <a href="http://hamvasbela.org/en/indexen.html">Béla Hamvas</a> would say – and even deeper, tapping into the divine essence of every one of us.</p>

<p>Meditation can mean different things for different people and that is what is beautiful about it. It could be as simple as just closing your eyes and sitting still. It's diving inwards, being with yourself. Bringing the focus within, instead of being preoccupied by the content of the senses.</p>

<p>The fact that our eyes are turned out, towards the world around us and are not able to look within shows the focus of our lives too. We are more concerned with what happens around us than within ourselves, being largely unfamiliar with our own body and mind. Meditation directs our mental eye back, making us become aware of our mental processes and emotions and helping us to become able to detach from them.</p>

<p>The physical exercises of yoga were initially just an introduction into meditation. The asanas were intended only for making the body strong and steady enough to be able to spend longer time meditating. According to Patanjali, the compiler of <a href="http://www.athayog.me.uk/sutra_ch1n.html">Yoga Sutras</a>, the classical text on yoga from somewhere around 400 BCE, yoga is about an encounter with the restless mind. Through a process of moral, physical and mental discipline the mind is purified and set free of itself - becoming like a clear water that reflects universal wisdom.</p>

<p>The motives for meditating in the contemporary society are much different than in the times of Patanjali. Instead of searching for wisdom we are more after the therapeutic benefits of meditation. The modern meditator is looking for a way to combat stress and rest from the chronic overload with unnecessary information. And that seems to be working as well - meditating seem to bring tangible benefits and could tightly fit the new, pragmatic purpose too.</p>

<p>There is a growing body of scientific research about benefits of different meditation techniques. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3004979/">One of the studies</a> for example, shows that regular practice of simple mindfulness meditation can cause structural changes in grey matter of the brain, especially in the areas in charge for learning and memory processes, emotion regulation and the perception of self. If you want to find out more, there is a nice article I recently found on <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/use-your-mind-change-your-brain/201305/is-your-brain-meditation">psychologytoday.com</a> that explains in plain language what happens with the brain "on meditation", check it out.</p>

<p>But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what your motivation to start practicing meditation is. The beautiful thing is that with time and patience your practice will grow out of any motive and become the purpose to itself. Meditation is not about achieving anything - it's about simplicity of going back to being instead of thinking about it.</p>

<p>Assuming stillness of the body we are diving into ourselves - staying quiet as sounds around us change, as our bodily sensations change, as our own thoughts unfold. Taking a step back and looking at our worries with detachment we suddenly feel like Alice in Wonderland, who realised that the Queen of Hearts and whole her army are just a stack of harmless playing cards.</p>

<p>And gradually, we become able to look beyond the content of the mind - reaching the silence beneath the words, discovering the life within us in all its beautiful simplicity.</p>

<p>Here are a few books that in one way or another influenced my meditation practice. I hope you will find some of them interesting.</p>
