## What to expect?

<div class="columns">

<p>
Each class is different, combining flowing dance-like sequences with traditional hatha yoga, reflection and meditation. I don’t believe in perfect alignment and trying to achieve a perfectly-looking final pose. It's more about exploring the body thorugh movement and breath, letting the inner life of the body unfold.</p>

<p>Please arrive 10 minutes earlier, wear comfortable clothes and try not to have a big meal minimum 2 hours before the class. You might feel more comfortable to practice on your own yoga mat, but let me know if you don't have any, I have a couple of spare mats too.</p>
