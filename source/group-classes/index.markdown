## What to expect?

<div class="columns">

<p>I find it important to approach every person as unique as they are, addressing individuals within a group. Tracking students' progress I plan the classes carefully having in mind the group as a whole and each person’s specific needs and abilities and the way they change.</p>

<p>The classes are always different, dedicated to a particular theme -  a more or less abstract concept or working on an area of the body. I like mixing active and quiet segments, combining flowing dance-like sequences with static Hatha postures, reflection and meditation.</p>
	
<p>Please arrive 10 minutes earlier, wear something comfortable and try not to have a big meal minimum 2 hours before the class. I have some yoga mats here, but feel free to bring your own if you prefer.</p>
