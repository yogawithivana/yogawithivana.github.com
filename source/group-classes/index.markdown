## What to expect?

<div class="columns">

	<p>The classes are always different and usually focussed on a particular concept or working on a certain area of the body. I like mixing active and quiet segments following both students' and my moods and energy levels, combining static Hatha postures with flowing dance-like sequences, reflection and meditation. I encourage my students to explore and play, making sure that everyone is getting the most out of their practice, whatever their abilities, and of course, that everyone is having fun.</p>

	<p>Please arrive 10 minutes earlier, wear something comfortable and try not to have a big meal minimum 2 hours before the class. I have some yoga mats here, but feel free to bring your own if you prefer.</p>
