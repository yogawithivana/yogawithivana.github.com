### What to expect?

<div class="columns">

<p>The classes are always different, from gentle to energetic, depending on both the students' and my moods and energy levels - playfully exploring, challenging and replenishing. You can expect both static Hatha postures and flowing sequences linking movement with the breath. Yoga for me does not mean only asanas, so I will try to bring into my classes a taste of other yogic techniques (pranayama, meditation, yoga nidra, reflection, kriyas) suited for time and space available, sharing with you the magic and transformative power of yoga as a philosophy and a way of life.</p>

<p>Please arrive 10 minutes earlier, so there is enough time to prepare for the class. Wear something loose and comfortable and try not to eat minimum 2 hours beforehand. Yoga mats will be provided, but feel free to bring your own.</p>
