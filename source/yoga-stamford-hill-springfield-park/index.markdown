<p>The class is held in our beautiful new studio near Springfield Park and the Lea River. We have yoga mats, blocks and cushions here and also a lot of lovely morning light, soothing essential oils and some beautiful classical Indian ragas to accompany our practice.</p>

<p>And I'll be proud to share with you some of the beautifully obscure teas that used to fill our suitcases on each of our travellings, from Argentinian mate to subtle Japanese sencha and genmaicha, chrysanthemum, rose buds, dried aloe vera or refreshing kuding cha from the south of China, aromatically spiced tulsi, Indian holy herb, or just a good old cup of nice breakfast tea.</p>

<p>If you travel by bus you can take either 253 or 254 to Clapton Common or 67, 76, 149, 243 or 476, to Egerton Road.</p>

<p>If you cycle, you are more than welcome to use our indoor bike shed.</p>

<p> Or if you decide to take a calming walk by the river instead, we are just a couple of houses down from the rowing club next to Springfield Park.</p>
