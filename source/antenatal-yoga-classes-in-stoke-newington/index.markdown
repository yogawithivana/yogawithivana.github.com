    <h3>Yoga throughout pregnancy</h3>
    
    <p>During the 9 months of pregnancy our bodies go through a variety of physiological changes. In early pregnancy yoga can help you adapt to the enormous hormonal changes and cope with tiredness and nausea. Later on, in mid pregnancy, as you are regaining the sense of vitality, yoga can help you get the most out of the transformative power of your body, build strenght and endurance and make more breathing space for two. Finally in the late pregnancy, as the body adjusts to the increasing weight you are carrying, yoga can help you protect the spine and prevent backache, alleviate common discomforts of pregnancy and prepare for a healthy and happy birth.</p>
    
    <h3>From our heads back to our bodies</h3>

    <p>Yoga takes us from thinking into being, out of our busy heads and back into the bodies. We develop awareness of the breath, the body and the presence of the growing little person within, learning how to really be there, grounded and present through all the changes rumbling through our lives. It can help us develop early bonding with the little ones and create a smooth transition into motherhood.</p>

    <h3>Yoga and labour</h3>

    <p>Yoga is a perfect preparation for childbirth. It helps us regain an instinctive awareness of the body, learning how to listen to its language and obey to its own intelligence. Yoga reconnects us with the instinctive breathing patterns that can help soothe the mind in labour, relieve pain and help the body bear the baby down in the second stage. The most comfortable yoga positions in pregnancy naturally extend into the labour itself. We get used to listen and trust to our body’s instincts and its natural ability to birth.</p>
