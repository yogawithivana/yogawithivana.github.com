    <h3>Yoga throughout pregnancy</h3>
    
    <p>During the 9 months of pregnancy our bodies go through a variety of physiological changes. In early pregnancy yoga can help you adapt to the enormous hormonal changes and cope with tiredness and nausea. Later on, in mid pregnancy, as you are regaining the sense of vitality, yoga can help you get the most out of the transformative power of your body, build strenght and endurance and make more space for the little one. Finally in the late pregnancy, as the body adjusts to the increasing weight you are carrying, yoga can help you protect the spine and prevent backache, alleviate common discomforts of pregnancy and prepare for a healthy and happy birth.</p>
    
    <h3>The miracle of life</h3>

    <p>Yoga takes us from thinking into being, out of our heads, back into our bodies. It brings greater self-awareness and awareness of the presence of the growing baby inside your body, of the miracle of creation happening within your body, the female divine force in each of us. Using the power of breath and movement you will learn how to release tension and go through this beautiful and fragile period of your life strong and relaxed.</p>

    <h3>Yoga and labour</h3>

    <p>Yoga is a perfect preparation for childbirth. It helps us regain the instinctive awareness of the body, learning how to listen to its language and obey to its own intelligence. Our bodies have been built for birthing and it’s just about learning to let the body do what it instinctively knows how to do and what women have been doing for thousands and thousands of years. The most comfortable yoga positions in pregnancy naturally extend into the labour itself. It becomes easier to listen to our body’s impulses and surrender to the powerful force of nature lying within us.</p>
