More time I spend learning about the body more I wonder: do we really need core strengthening exercises to make us strong? We might be trying to solve a wrong problem, blaming everything on “the core” as some powerful source of strength inside the body that we need to strengthen in isolation from everything else.

Our hunter-gatherer ancestors never went to a gym and probably never ever thought of doing any core strengthening and still had enough core strength to survive in wilderness hunting their lunch. But the thing is, they moved — all day, every day, more in summer, less in winter, but at least a couple of miles every day. They climbed trees, carried their children, sat on the ground to prepare their food and eat. And none of them ever even heard of core stability.

Our modern weak core epidemic, sort of, is a response to the way we live and use our bodies day to day — driving everywhere, spending most time sitting on couches and comfortable chairs. There is rarely any need to use your core, unless maybe sometimes carrying a suitcase up the stairs when the lift is out of order or occasionally moving a piece of furniture. And then you throw your back out.

We need to think out of ‘the core’ to fix the core — biomechanicist and researcher Katy Bowman says. The same as what we eat shapes us, the way we move over time shapes us too. Not just exercise, but every movement and lack there of counts in.

Can 3–5 hours in the gym offset the rest of the week spent sitting, pretty much in one position every day from nine to five? Mathematically it doesn’t make much sense, does it?

<h3>It’s often not strength that is the problem, but mobility.</h3>

Our bodies have adapted to very limited use and repetitive positioning of the joints throughout the day. As some of our hardly used joints stiffen and whole areas of the body clump together, unable to move independently, the joints that still DO move have to bear all of the strain for the ones that don’t. And this is the body we bring into the gym and “challenge”, pretty much asking for injury.

‘You’ll often find that “hard moves” you thought you weren’t strong enough to do were actually hard because your body wasn’t mobile enough to capitalise on the geometry that makes them doable.’ — Bowman says. Through using the body more and in more ways, we can restore mobility in the stiff areas and allow muscles to do their job in stabilising the body as we move.

It’s all about bringing movement back into the way we live, bit by bit. Not only in the gym. Not only to “challenge” ourselves after a whole day or even weeks and months of not moving.

<h3>Exercises are useful, but they just can’t work in isolation. It’s what we do all day that counts.</h3>

Bowman makes an interesting parallel between movement and nutrition in which exercises are seen as micronutrients, useful as a supplement only, but not able to substitute a healthy diet. As the unmissable macronutrients of human movement she lists:

- Walking
- Squatting and sitting on the floor
- Lifting and carrying
- Hanging and climbing.

Our core works in respond to every movement of the body, and the lack of movement. No matter what kind of a core strengthening programme you might use, if you don’t move that much or that well your core will continue being weak.

A healthy body stabilises itself in response to an activity, dynamically adapting to the movement. It’s all about proprioception — sensing and responding to the environment as we move. Using our hands and feet as sensory organs we can allow the body to stabilise itself naturally responding to the demands of movement. And even looking deeper into the body. Our muscles not just execute the movement but also react to the sensory input of the environment, tensing and releasing when needed.

<h3>Our bodies have the ability to stabilise themselves dynamically as we move.</h3>

And this is basically the same view I found in work of dance educator Hubert Godard — there is no need to keep the tension in the centre but allow the body to respond freely to movement, gliding fluidly between the earth and the sky.

There is no need to try to willingly engage your belly to stabilise the spine overriding the body’s instinctive response to movement. If you need to make an effort to activate your core squeezing and forcing, it probably means that either your muscles are not sensing the load or the load is more than your current core strength — Bowman says.

But what we can do is release the belly, instead of keeping it pulled in all the time, and keep moving as much as possible and in as many ways as possible to keep our joints supple and our muscles at optimal length, leaving space for the body to stabilise itself as and when needed. A relaxed and responsive body is a strong body.
