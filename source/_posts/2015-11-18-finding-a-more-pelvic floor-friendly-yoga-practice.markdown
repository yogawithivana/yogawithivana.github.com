*A couple of ideas on having a more pelvic-floor-friendly yoga practice*

It is quite common to hear yoga teachers saying ‘tuck the tailbone under’ when they want to initiate action from the ‘core’ (mulabandha). This might be useful in some cases, working with beginners and people who don’t have much awareness of their pelvic floor and the action of tucking the tail can help them access the muscles their brain doesn’t ‘talk to’. But ’tucking the tailbone’ is used way too much and often unnecessarily. Some yoga styles even encourage keeping the tailbone tucked under in most poses for ‘stability’.

The problem is, this instruction could be:

* *Misleading* — Pelvic floor lift in yoga (mulabandha) should come from toning and lifting at the central tendon of the pelvic floor (between the openings) and not from the action of the tailbone. Telling students to tuck the tailbone makes them over-activate wrong muscles — gripping the gluteals, tightening the hamstrings, the deep hip rotators and the very back of the pelvic floor, without lifting the central tendon.

* *Exposing you to injury* — When you curl the tailbone under trying to stabilise the body, tightening your gluteals and the hips together with the rectus abdominis (the ‘six pack’) flattens the lower back. This interferes with the stabilising action of the transversus abdominis (TVA) in front and the lumbar multifidus muscles in the back. [The multifidi can’t work properly when the back is flat.](http://alinenewton.com/pdf-articles/core.htm) This is why a lot of people end up with back pain after classes that focus on ‘core strength’.

* *Bad for your pelvic floor* — keeping the tailbone under we decrease the space between the pubic bone and the tailbone i.e. shorten the pelvic floor. Continuously contracting the pelvic floor while keeping it short [will pull the sacrum into the bowl of the pelvis causing your pelvic floor to slack.](http://mamasweat.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/pelvic-floor-party-kegels-are-not.html) Doing more ‘strengthening’ work with your tail tucked under will make your pelvic floor even shorter and tighter, but not stronger. Unlike the TVA that (as a purely stabilising muscle) can work for longer periods of time, [the pelvic floor should activate only when we need an extra burst of energy](http://www.somatics.de/Godard/ReadingBodyInDance.pdf) and then release to its full length. ‘Keeping it lifted’ = pelvic floor disorders in a long term.

There are a couple of alternatives that could help us avoid the pitfalls of of ‘tucking the tailbone under’.

Maybe a better way to perform mulabandha, would be to [keep the pelvis in a neutral position](https://theverticalworkshop.wordpress.com/2011/04/01/neutral-pelvis-and-neutral-spine-what-are-they-and-why-do-we-care/) and try to initiate the lift from the central tendon of the pelvic floor, without tucking the tailbone.

I usually say ‘**lift from the base of the torso**’. This way we promote the toning action of the pelvic floor, without shortening the muscle. There is no need to squeeze the sphincters, it’s enough to tone and lift the muscle gently midway between the openings.

To be able to identify the right muscle, instead of focusing on action of the tailbone I find it useful to **pay attention to action of sitbones**, which with the lift of the pelvic floor come closer and with the release slide apart. This way we can initiate movement from the pelvic floor, without over contracting it.

Even more pelvic-floor-friendly way to practise yoga would be to **use mulabandha only as an exception and instead focus on stabilising the torso from front and back** (using co-activation of TVA and lumbar multifidus muscles as the primary stabilisation system). This way we can have both stability and much more freedom and fluidity in the moving asana practice.

To initiate stabilising action of the TVA I would say ‘tone the lower abdomen, narrowing the hip points’ or ‘**draw the hip points towards each other**’. [Doug Keller](http://www.doyoga.com/resources.html) uses a nice hint here, saying ‘imagine pulling the drawstring on a pair of sweatpants tighter’. Using the **Ujjayi breath** helps to naturally initiate this action.

If you on top of it say ‘**keep your pelvis neutral**’, you can make sure that the lumbar multifidus muscles which protect the discs in the lower back automatically co-contract with TVA completely stabilising the torso.
And you can always add an extra lift from the pelvic floor to ‘energise the movement’ when needed.

In case of people who have little control over their pelvic floor and have difficulty in activating their deep abdominal muscles (e.g. after childbirth) we need to first reconnect the neural pathways to be able to recruit the muscles. Instead of using the hint to ‘tuck the tailbone’ here, I find it useful to make them squeeze a block or a small ball with the tights while trying to gently tone the lower belly, just above the pubic bone, keeping the pelvis in a neutral position.

Please don’t take me wrong, tucking tailbone is not bad in itself and please do use it as a part of a varied movement diet! But there is really no need to use it as a default when practising yoga or living our lives.
