### Searching for Wisdom or Escaping the Information Overload? 

In spite of the popular belief, meditation is not just an esoteric Eastern practice. In one form or another and under different names it has been around for centuries in both East and West as part of various intellectual and religious practices. So when saying meditation, we can talk about a number of quite heterogeneous techniques involving mental discipline and concentration. The span goes from repetition of mantras and Tantric visualisations, over [Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/en/vipassana.shtml) and prayer-meditations of Christian sages, all the way to Sherlock Holmes's ["throwing brain out of action"](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/16/opinion/sunday/the-power-of-concentration.html?_r=0) And the list is far from exhausted. But what is it that is common to all these different practices? 

In practical terms meditation means bringing the focus within, to the inward life, instead of being preoccupied by the content of the senses. The very fact that our eyes are turned out, towards the world around us and are not able to look within shows the focus of our lives too. We are more concerned with what happens around us than within ourselves, being largely unfamiliar with our own body and mind. Meditation directs our mental eye back, making us become aware of our mental processes and emotions and helping us to become able to detach from them.

The physical exercises of yoga were traditionally just an introduction into meditation. The asanas were initially intended only for making the body strong and steady enough to be able to sit for long time in meditative postures. According to Patanjali, the compiler of [Yoga Sutras](http://www.athayog.me.uk/sutra_ch1n.html), the classical text on yoga from somewhere around 400 BCE, yoga is about an encounter with the restless mind, breaking out of its innate tendency to fabricate thoughts and trying to reach stillness. Through a process of moral, physical and mental discipline the mind is purified and set free of itself - becoming like a clear water that reflects universal wisdom.

The motives for meditating in the contemporary society are much different than in the times of Patanjali. Instead of searching for wisdom we are more after the therapeutic benefits of meditation, looking for a way to combat stress and find some peace from being constantly overloaded with unnecessary information. Nevertheless, the meditation perfectly fits the new purpose too, being an universal tool for mind-taming and its cultivation.

Meditation is not about mystical experiences - it's about simplicity of going back to being instead of thinking about it. Assuming stillness of the body we are diving inwards, into ourselves - staying quiet as sounds around us change, as our bodily sensations change, as our own thoughts unfold. We just sit quietly and listen, with a witness-like attitude. And gradually we become able to look beyond the content of the mind - reaching the silence beneath the words, the life within us, instead of the mere thought about it.

Here are a few books that in one way or another influenced my meditation practice. I hope you will find some of them interesting.
