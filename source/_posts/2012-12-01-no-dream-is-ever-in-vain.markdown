Some dreams never come true, but the very fact that they don't makes you become who you are. They keep their fragile existence glittering in front of your eyes, just beyond the reach of your hands, making you do things you could have never ever imagined you were able to achieve. And that ends up being their purpose, staying a dream forever but making you turn a number of other dreams into reality along the way. Have faith in your dreams, none of them is ever in vain.
