Some dreams never come true, but the very fact that they don't makes us become who we are. They keep their fragile existence fluttering in front of our eyes, making us do things we could have never imagined we were able to achieve. And that ends up being their purpose, staying a dream forever but making us turn a number of other dreams into reality along the way. Have faith in your dreams, none of them is ever in vain.
