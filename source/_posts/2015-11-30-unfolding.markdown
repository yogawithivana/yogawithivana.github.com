Simply open your fingers</br>
Let the squashed little bird</br>
With ruffled feathers</br>
Fly out of your palm</br>
</br>
No need for clenching</br>
Just soften, release the fists</br>
We are not here to defeat the world</br>
But offer ourselves as a gift</br>
</br>
Open your hands with courage</br>
The whole universe pulsates</br>
In each of your trembling fingers</br>
Fragile and eager</br>
</br>
Just open to wonder</br>
Allow the tender petals to unfold</br>
And bloom effortlessly</br>
Through your fingertips</br>
