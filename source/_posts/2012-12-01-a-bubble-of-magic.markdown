As a kid I was always fascinated with soap bubbles. I learnt how to multiply and recycle them, dreaming of a soap bubble that would last forever. But would it still be precious? There is nothing really valuable in soap.

The beauty of a soap bubble is in its fragility, in its impermanence. Things that are there all the time start to feel less precious. But if we are aware of each moment as it happens there is no need to ask for it to last forever. Every moment could be a new and wondrous experience, a soap bubble of magic in our lives.
