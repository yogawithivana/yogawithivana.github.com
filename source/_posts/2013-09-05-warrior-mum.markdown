I've been really enjoying teaching pregnancy yoga while being pregnant, sharing the practice with my lovely group of mums-to-be, going together through all the ups and downs of this fragile but powerful period of our lives and being inspired by each other. 

It's beautiful how every person and every pregnancy is different and it's even more important than usually to be open to sense the needs of each student and how they change. I've learnt so much more teaching these classes comparing to the knowledge I had after completing my pregnancy yoga training and the later learning through my own yoga practice while pregnant.

The funny thing is that now I'm the most pregnant of all my students, bouncing around with my huge baby bump. Trying to run around the group helping everyone out with slight modifications of postures became a bit of a challenge. So, entering my 39th week, I've decided to start the maternity leave.

The last class for this season was dedicated to a theme I wanted to focus on for quite some time - Warrior Mum.

I love the warrior poses, with their strong grounded feet, the open heart and arms expanding powerfully up or to the sides. According to yoga every physical posture (asana) cultivates a certain attitude if performed regularly and with dedication, so flexibility of the body becomes flexibility of the mind. The warrior poses in this sense cultivate courage and open-heartedness, floating over the strong feet with wide open arms and giving hands. A beautiful metaphor for motherhood!

Recently I came upon an interesting [TED talk by Amy Cuddy](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html), a social psychologist from Harvard who doesn't have to do anything with yoga, but thinks that bodily postures we regularly assume shape the way we feel about ourselves and others. So, the poses of power, as she calls them, with legs comfortably apart and chest proudly forward, not only leave that impression on others, but can also boost our confidence and encourage us to develop such qualities in ourselves. Classical warrior would be a great example of a power pose in this sense.

The physical part of the class was focussed on energising flowing sequences based on and around the warrior poses. We started gradually preparing the body through loosening the spine, opening the hips and chest and strengthening the legs for a firmer grip in these powerful standing poses. I also found it useful to finish the class with more restorative poses releasing the tension in the lower back and hips.

Here are the little stick-men I drew planning this class:
