I’ve been just watching [Tom Myers’s DVD training in bodyreadying](http://anatomytrains.co.uk/?wpsc-product=bodyreading-101-visual-assessment) for manual and movement therapists. Have never really seen anyone explain the postural tilts and shifts so beautifully. Another thing I really liked is that he doesn’t just readjust the body as it ‘should be’ but explores where to get that extra little space for expansion, making the adjustment sustainable.

It’s a great challenge working with people and having to tell them ‘however you have been wearing your body until now is wrong and you should change it’. It sounds quite arrogant, doesn’t it? The same as we each have our own version of reality, we have our own sense for the position of our body parts in relation to each other and sense of what is ‘normal’. We are in a sort of balance, however much the body compensated with different tilts and shifts to get us there and can’t consciously change our alignment to something that feels a bit awkward.

The new alignment should not only look better but feel better. We need to work together with the body and allow it to find a sustainable solution in realigning itself, rather that force it into a particular ‘healthy’ alignment.

Our bodies are beautifully plastic and can adapt to most lifestyles and compensate for our postural habits in a variety of ways. Similarly they can gradually grow into a better alignment, if we not only force changes but make space for expansion, space to grow into.

This makes me think of Chinese gardens. Travelling in China a couple of years ago, I was blown away by the beauty and tranquil atmosphere of these places, usually in the cities. As opposed to Western tightly trimmed grass and perfectly symmetrical lanes of flowers, Chinese gardens focus on wild beauty of nature, creating the effect that ‘although made by mankind, it seemed created by God’. They don’t try to tame nature but work together with it, making space in which nature can grow of its own accord.

For me personally, this extra space was upwards - axial extension, how [Lesslie Kaminoff](http://www.yogaanatomy.org/about/) described it in his Yoga Anatomy. Ever since I first time tried upward stretches at the Yoga Institute in Santacruz East, Mumbai I kept practising them many times per day, pretty much any time when I remembered. And this made me grow 2 cm taller, although already in my early thirties. The spine realigned itself, slightly decreasing its excessive curvature and getting some more length.

This sustainability of the change is a detail a lot of fitness experts don’t really pay much attention to. They say: drop the ribs, untuck the pelvis, check yourself in the mirror and just keep checking if you are in alignment thousand times a day. I really think that we need to allow the body to find its own way, otherwise we’ll get the same yo-yo effect as with dieting.

The change in alignment has to sink in at subconscious level. Otherwise it just doesn’t feel natural. The body has to grow into it as its new normal.

Oh, funnily enough, practising [Katy Bowman’s squats](http://www.katysays.com/you-dont-know-squat/) multiple times a day I realised that the thing my body misses there is a bit of length in the spine. So I raised the arms. And there it is — the simple Hatha yoga utkatasana, the chair pose. Old Hatha yogis were real biohackers!
