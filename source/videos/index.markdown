### Pregnancy Yoga - Part 1: Opening and Softening

This first part of the practice is focussed on soft flowing postures waking up the spine, loosening tension in the hip area and relieving pressure on pelvic ligaments. We will do plenty of gentle round movements opening and energising the pelvic area, strengthening the lower back and preparing the body for a bit more vigorous sequences in the second part.

The practice is gentle and generally suitable for any stage of pregnancy, however make sure that you listen to your body and stay within the limits of what feels comfortable.

### Pregnancy Yoga - Part 2: Warrior Mum

The second, more energetic part of the practice is dedicated to flowing sequences based on and around warrior and powerful high squats, interlaced with short periods of relaxation. The focus is on opening the hips and chest and building confidence. 

We start slowly, loosening the joints and build up to a more vigorous practice, gradually strengthening the legs for a firmer grip in these powerful standing poses. The practice ends with restorative poses releasing the tension in the lower back and hips and a longer relaxation.
