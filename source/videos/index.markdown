### Pregnancy Yoga - Part 1: Opening and Softening

This first part of the practice is dedicated to gentle round movements loosening the tension in the lower back, opening and energising the hips and the pelvic area. There is also a plenty of nice chest openers and soft flowing postures focussing on the upper body in general.

The practice is gentle and generally suitable for any stage of pregnancy, however make sure that you listen to your body and stay within the limits of what feels comfortable.

### Pregnancy Yoga - Part 2: Warrior Mum

The second part of the practice features an energetic, yet gentle flow based on and around warrior and powerful high squats. The focus is on building strength and confidence. The more vigorous practices are interlaced with recuperating periods of relaxation, making sure the sequence is suitable for the delicate period of pregnancy. 

We wrap up the practice with a couple of restorative postures focussing on the lower back and hip pain, ending with deep relaxation.

I hope you will find the videos helpful and fun!
