<p>Hi there! My name is Ivana. I'm a yoga practitioner, a teacher and a mum to a lively toddler who makes me learn something new every day. I find great inspiration in Indian philosophy, non-violence, movement and silence. I'm also a bit of a science geek, passionate about understanding our bodies and how to optimise them. I have a soft spot for hazelnuts, film and rooftops and you can usually find me singing on the bicycle.</p>

<p>In over 1200 hrs of my training so far I have been fortunate to study with some lovely teachers in both East and West, focusing mostly on what we in the West would call yoga therapy. I'm really inspired by work of Doug Keller, Marc Beuvain and Uma Dinsmore-Tuli.</p>

One of the main highlights of my yoga journey has been studying classical yoga with The Yoga Institute Santacruz in Mumbai, India. The Institute is a modest, traditionally organised school with ashram. It was founded in 1918 by Shri Yogendra, disciple of Paramahamsa Madhavdasji and since then run by Yogendra family in spirit of Bhagavad Gita and karma yoga. During the summer and autumn I spent living at their ashram I could dedicate my time to in-depth study of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and other classical yoga texts and volunteering in The Institute's health camps, teaching yoga to local people.</p>

<p>Last October I was lucky to study anatomy and yoga as therapy with Doug Keller, during his year's stay in London. And I have continued to study Doug's extensive work in spite of the distance, fascinated by his research bringing together Ayurveda with contemporary myofascial work, understanding biomechanics of our body and its energetic background.</p>

<p>In my view a good yoga teacher should be just an unobtrusive facilitator of each student's own practice. So this would be my teaching ideal. A yoga teacher should be like a gardener. The only thing he/she can do is to try to create perfect conditions for each plant to grow, making sure there is enough sun or shade, the soil is humid and fertile. But it's up to each flower to grow - at its own pace and as unique as it is.</p>
