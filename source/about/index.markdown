<p>Hi there! My name is Ivana. I'm a dedicated yoga practitioner and teacher accredited by <a href="http://www.independentyoganetwork.org/">the Independent Yoga Network</a> (500 Hrs). I'm grateful to have had a chance to learn yoga in both East and West, discovering the beauty of humility, discipline and the intuitive approach from Hindu teachers, but also precision, anatomy and alignment from Western teachers. I find great inspiration in Yoga Sutras, nonviolence, reverential ecology of Satish Kumar, mindfulness meditation and classical Indian dance.</p>

<p>I did my first yoga teacher training with the lovely people of the Yoga Federation of Serbia back in my home country. It was a 260h programme spread over 8 months of theory and practice, based on the holistic approach to yoga, inspired by Tantra and Bihar school of yoga tradition.</p>

<p>The journey took me further to India where I studied classical yoga at <a href="http://theyogainstitute.org/">the Yoga Institute Santacruz</a> in Mumbai. And this was probably the most transformative part of my journey. The Institute is a modest, traditionally organised school with ashram founded in 1918 by Shri Yogendra, disciple of Paramahamsa Madhavdasji and since then run by Yogendra family in spirit of Bhagavad Gita and karma yoga.</p>

<p>Although a good part of the Institute's work is what we in the West would call yoga therapy, they never use this very expression, but simply say that they teach yoga to everyone. Yoga is not a pill - my teacher Hansaji would say. Healing that comes as a result of the practice is just a by-product of living in harmony with yourself and the world.</p> 

<p>During the summer and autumn I spent living at the Institute's ashram we had a chance to work in health camps dedicated to people with various orthopaedic, cardiac and respiratory disorders, women during pregnancy and in postnatal period and children with special needs. Yoga doesn't treat an illness but the man as whole - they say at the Institute - making you live a happier, more balanced and more fulfilled life in spite of the illness. </p>

<p>Ever since returning from India I keep learning, keeping a devoted daily practice, studying anatomy and physiology, regularly attending different classes and workshops and adding more Western, body-oriented and scientifically based training to my background. This autumn I am attending an advanced teacher training in anatomy and class sequencing with Dough Keller at Yoga Campus, London.</p>

<p>I see a good yoga teacher as warm, modest, inspiring and funny. We don't live in times of great gurus living for 200 years and hanging upside down from a tree. A good contemporary yoga teacher in my view should be just an unobtrusive facilitator of each student's personal practice. So this would be my teaching ideal. Creating an honest and encouraging environment I try to leave space for every student to find intimacy with their own breaths and movements; to release and embrace their own uniqueness within the group without fear of looking funny or not being able to stretch to a certain point. I find it important that every student feels as much at ease with their practice as if they were alone in their own room, while at the same time belonging to the group and sharing energy with the group.</p>

<p>I think that a good yoga teacher should be like a gardener. The only thing he/she can do is to create favourable conditions for each plant to grow, making sure there is enough sun or shade, if that is what a certain flower needs, the soil is humid and fertile. But it's up to each flower to grow - at its own pace and as unique as it is.</p>
