<p>Hi there! My name is Ivana. I'm a yoga practitioner, a teacher and a mum to a lively toddler who makes me learn something new every day. I find great inspiration in Indian philosophy, non-violence, movement and silence. I'm also a bit of a science geek, passionate about understanding our bodies and how to optimise them. I have a soft spot for hazelnuts, film and rooftops and you can usually find me singing on the bicycle.</p>

<p>In over 1200 hrs of my training so far I have been fortunate to study with some lovely teachers in both East and West, focusing mostly on classical yoga and yoga as therapy.</p>

<p>I did my first yoga teacher training with the Yoga Federation of Serbia, back in my home country, mostly based on Sivananda yoga and Bihar School of Yoga traditions.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.yogawithivana.com/thoughts/2012/02/18/my-yoga-story/">The journey</a> took me further to India where I studied classical yoga with The Yoga Institute in Santacruz East, Mumbai. The Institute is a modest, traditionally organised school with ashram. It was founded in 1918 by Shri Yogendra, disciple of Paramahamsa Madhavdasji and since then run by Yogendra family in spirit of Bhagavad Gita and karma yoga. During the summer and autumn I spent living at their ashram I could dedicate my time to in-depth study of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and other classical yoga texts and volunteering in The Institute's health camps, teaching yoga to local people.</p>

<p>Afer India, I attended a number of intensives at Yogacampus, London, mostly focussing on anatomy and yoga as therapy. And I continue to study, from my teachers and students alike and nurturing my own daily yoga and meditation practice.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying Doug Keller's work bringing together Ayurveda with contemporary myofascial research, understanding biomechanics of our body and its energetic background. I'm also fascinated with the more feminine approaches to yoga, especially the work of Donna Farhi and Uma Dinsmore-Tuli, finding the way to live the philosophy of Yoga Sutras through motherhood. In last couple of years I've been spending most of my time working with mums-to-be and new mums.</p>

<p>In my view a good yoga teacher should be just an unobtrusive facilitator of each student's own practice. So this would be my teaching ideal. A yoga teacher should be like a gardener. The only thing he/she can do is to try to create perfect conditions for each plant to grow, making sure there is enough sun or shade, the soil is humid and fertile. But it's up to each flower to grow - at its own pace and as unique as it is.</p>
