<p>My asana style draws on classical Hatha yoga, Sivananda, Iyengar yoga and the moving meditation of Vinyasa Flow, exploring and connecting. I also have some hands-on experience in teaching yoga to people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory and orthopedic problems, using yoga in dealing with stress management, weight management, yoga in pregnancy - prenatal and postnatal yoga and modifying yoga asanas for other specific needs.</p>

### My Yoga Story

<div class="columns">

<p>Trying to describe the difference that yoga has made in my life, I would compare it with the sun behind and out of clouds. Everything is still standing where it used to be, but painted in brighter, more vibrant colours, feeling fuller, richer and more real. Yoga brought together so many different puzzle pieces that I was collecting for years, encompassing values that I was unknowingly developing throughout my life. It felt like coming home.</p>

#### Silence

<div class="columns">

<p>I have been always fascinated with sound - I grew up surrounded with music, my dad was teaching guitar. It was through music that I learnt to make my mind clear of thoughts and just be, diving into every sound separately, letting them make me spontaneously smile. Through sound I discovered my fascination with silence, warm textures composed of different little noises melting into one. I often remember places by their silence. I love silence of rooftops, for example, made of faraway traffic noises softly melting into children laughter or sound of cutlery from a nearby restaurant. Through silence I've learnt to listen to my breath, to become aware of it.</p>

#### Movement

<p>In-line skating has been my passion for more than 10 years. I used to skate every day, just putting my skates on and sailing the streets, switching my mind off and completely immersing into the long smooth movements, feeling the wheels caressing the asphalt as if they were my own soles. Practicing yoga asanas made me revive this passion for movement after years of sedentary lifestyle and work in a stress-charged law office, spending hours in front of the computer. Yoga made me regain connection with my own body and revive my flexibility.</p>

#### Home

<div class="columns">

<p>I was born in a small town on the River Drina in former Yugoslavia. Since then I moved over 30 times, first to Belgrade, then Budapest, Berlin, Amsterdam, London. Changes became a part of who I was and I kept restlessly moving around, trying to fill an emptiness of not feeling at home by moving again and again. It was the first time through yoga that I learnt to feel at home. I realised that home is not a place but a feeling.</p>

#### The Love Story

<div class="columns">

<p>I went to my first yoga class during my student days, but I truly fell in love with yoga just years later, in 2010. Things we are looking for are often already there, around the corner, but we just don't see them. I guess the moment has to be right and you have to be ready to see it. This is how I met my husband too. We lived in Budapest 3 streets away from each other and though interested in very similar things we never met. And then years later when I was already living in Amsterdam for years and he in London, we both came to Budapest for a weekend and met each other. Less than half a year later we got married. Sometimes things just feel right and it's difficult to explain, you just have that feeling in your stomach. It feels like you have always known each other somehow.</p>

#### Something That Matters

<div class="columns">

<p>I spent 9 years of my life studying law and working in a corporate law office. Being a lawyer felt like being on a wrong bus, but warm and cosy enough to prevent me to simply get off. "When you feel fire lighting up within you just run" says one writer from my home country - "you never know when the flame is going to die out and leave you alone in the darkness". I think I was lucky to recognise the right moment and jump off. So I decided to quit my career in pursue of something that matters. This wasn't an easy journey, however I never looked back. And slowly I started to discover my forgotten talents and passions. Very slowly I started to overcome the fear of empty paper and draw again, learn graphic/web design and study human computer interaction. I started to sing and write, discovered my talent for photography. Yoga was a catalyzer and the driving force of my search for that something that matters, but completing the first teacher's training I realised that yoga IS that something. And this is where my real journey began.</p>

#### Sharing

<div class="columns">

<p>I did my first yoga teacher training course with the Yoga Federation of Serbia in my home country. It was a 200h training spread over 8 months, based on the holistic approach to yoga and inspired by Bihar school of yoga and Sivananda yoga tradition. Although I initially started the training with the idea of using yoga to encourage my husband and me to move a bit more and even without a serious intention to teach other people, I discovered along the way how rich and beautiful yoga is and how much more than just asanas. Learning from the lovely people of the Yoga Federation of Serbia inspired me to integrate yoga philosophy in my in everyday life, with head, heart and hand. I experienced how heart-warming it is to see glowing faces of people coming out of your lesson, energized and rejuvenated, how beautifully rewarding it is to share knowledge and passion for yoga and help someone to feel better.</p>

<p>After completing the first 200h training I realised that this qualification makes me competent to work only with young and healthy people and not everybody is. My father has type 2 diabetes and I felt powerless in my attempt to help him with my knowledge at that point. I wanted to learn how to modify yoga postures and use other yogic techniques in work with people with chronic health conditions. Also I felt the need to deepen my knowledge of the yoga philosophy and experience the life of a yoga student in India, so much different than here in the West, living under the same roof with the teacher, sitting by the teacher's feet and adopting the knowledge as a way of life, living and breathing yoga. This summer/autumn I spent 3.5 months the Yoga Institute Santacruz in Mumbai, which is established in 1918 by Shri Yogendraji and highly respected in yoga therapy circles. I lived in the ashram, studying full time and assisting in teaching local people as a part of various health camps that the Institute regularly held.</p>

#### Life-Long Learning

<div class="columns">

<p>Spending more time learning yoga, more I'm aware of it's deepness and endlessness. Even after years of studying it feels like you have just scraped the surface of its vast amount of knowledge. Yoga is an experiential science, a way of life, slowly climbing up the 8-fold path, overcoming your kleshas in the pursuit of the stoppage of all fluctuations of the mind. I am just at the beginning of my journey and there is still a long way to go, but I'm happy to search for it. I believe in life-long learning, being receptive and open to always look at things in a new way. I believe in humility and dedication and learning not only with mind but also hearth and stomach.</p>
