<p>Hi there! My name is Ivana. I'm a practitioner,  teacher and an ever-learning student of yoga and it never stops to enchant and amaze me. I'm passionate about Indian philosophy, especially Advaita Vedanta and on the other hand about understanding our bodies and how to optimise them. Yoga for me means cultivating a balanced state of mind and a life of elegant simplicity. </p>

<p>In around 1200 hrs of my training so far I have been fortunate to study with some lovely teachers in both East and West. And I find if a beautiful challenge to try to marry Eastern humility and self-discipline with the Western view of yoga as freedom and empowerment. </p>

Maybe the most transformative part of my journey has been studying classical yoga and yoga as therapy with The Yoga Institute Santacruz in Mumbai. The Institute is a modest, traditionally organised school with ashram. It was founded in 1918 by Shri Yogendra, disciple of Paramahamsa Madhavdasji and since then run by Yogendra family in spirit of Bhagavad Gita and karma yoga.</p>

<p>During the summer and autumn I spent living at their ashram I had a chance to work in health camps dedicated to people with orthopaedic, cardiac and respiratory disorders, women during pregnancy and in postnatal period and children with special needs. And this was really a life-changing experience, understanding the true meaning of yoga of action.</p>

<p>This October I was lucky to attend an intensive training in anatomy and yoga as therapy with Doug Keller at Yogacampus, during his year's stay in London. And I have continued to study Doug's extensive work in spite of the distance, fascinated by his research bringing together Ayurveda with contemporary myofascial work, understanding biomechanics of our body and its energetic background.</p>

<p>In my view a good yoga teacher should be just an unobtrusive facilitator of each student's personal practice. So this would be my teaching ideal. A yoga teacher should be like a gardener. The only thing he/she can do is to create favourable conditions for each plant to grow, making sure there is enough sun or shade, if that is what a certain flower needs, the soil is humid and fertile. But it's up to each flower to grow - at its own pace and as unique as it is.</p>
