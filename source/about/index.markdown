<p>Hi there! My name is Ivana Demmel. I'm a dedicated yoga practitioner, a teacher with over 1000 hours of training and an ever-learning student of yoga. My teaching style reflects my fascination with silence, logic and movement, drawing on various influences from traditional to contemporary. Lately I find great inspiration in Angela Farmerâ€™s fluid, explorative movement and Scaravelli's work with breath and gravity.</p>

<p>The main part of my studies was in classical Raja yoga - Ashtanga yoga and yoga therapy (as we in the West would call it) with <a href="http://theyogainstitute.org/">the Yoga Institute Santacruz</a> in Mumbai, India. Traditionally yoga is not seen as a cure for disease and healing that comes as a result of the practice is only seen as a by-product of living in harmony with yourself and the world. Yoga is not a pill - my teacher would say. Yoga doesn't treat an illness but the man as whole. Offering much more than a temporary relief it can help one live happier, more balanced and more fulfilled life in spite of the illness. During the time I spent living at the Institute's ashram I had a chance to work in health camps dedicated to people with diabetes, hypertension, cardiac disease, asthma, arthritis, women during pregnancy and in postnatal period and children with special needs.</p>

<p>Being passionate about Indian philosophy I dedicate every free moment to read about Samkhya, Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism and other ancient systems of thought from Indian subcontinent. I find the cornerstone of my practice in wisdom of Yoga Sutras and Bhagavad Gita, seeing yoga as a search for wholeness pursued through discipline, humility and gratitude.</p>

<p>Yoga for me means going back home to who you really are. Discovering beauty in being a tiny acorn with a potential to grow into a whole oak tree. Embracing all your weaknesses and imperfections and working from there. Embracing the world as it is and as it changes. Breathing, moving, smiling, loving, sharing, giving.</p>

<p>I see a good yoga teacher as warm, modest, inspiring and funny. We don't live in times of great gurus living for 200 years and hanging upside down from a tree. A good contemporary yoga teacher in my view should be just an unobtrusive facilitator of each student's personal practice. So this would be my teaching ideal. Creating an honest and encouraging environment I try to leave space for every student to find intimacy with their own breaths and movements; to release and embrace their own uniqueness within the group without fear of looking funny or not being able to stretch to a certain point. I find it important that every student feels as much at ease with their practice as if they were alone in their own room, while at the same time belonging to the group and sharing energy with the group.</p>

<p>I think that a good yoga teacher should be like a gardener. The only thing he/she can do is to create favourable conditions for each plant to grow, making sure there is enough sun or shade, if that is what a certain flower needs, the soil is humid and fertile. But it's up to each flower to grow - at its own pace and as unique as it is.</p>
