<p>One-to-ones are a very rewarding way of practising - at your own pace, with full attention and a lot of feedback. You can focus on a specific aim (e.g. recovering from an injury, improving a chronic health problem), or maybe give more time to something that you found difficult in a group class or would like to explore deeper. We will work together to develop a practice that is totally suited to you and you can integrate it into your daily life. Please mail me for a brochure with more details.</p>
