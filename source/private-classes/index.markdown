<p>Private tuition is a very rewarding way of practising where you can get full attention and a lot of feedback. The sessions are fully tailored to your needs and interests and can help you focus on a specific aim (e.g. losing weight, recovering from an injury), work on something that you've find difficult in a group class or would like to explore deeper.</p>
