Yoga is...  
Learning to be here and now  
Feeling your feet touching the ground  
Breathing the movement  
  
Gentle and intense Hatha yoga lessons with softly flowing physical postures, breathing exercises and deep relaxation. Suitable for any level of ability. Private and corporate classes also available.
