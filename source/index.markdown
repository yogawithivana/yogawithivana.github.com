<p>Teaching yoga for me means inspiring and empowering, helping a student discover his inner strength and always move his limits a bit further.</p>

<p>Yoga has helped me break out of a wrong career path as a lawyer, releasing and embracing my creative self. Through yoga I have discovered myself as an artist and traveller, brave and full of energy. I've discovered humility and gratitude towards the world and the beauty of being a tiny part in a larger process of life. Sharing my knowledge and passion is my way to express this gratitude.</p>
