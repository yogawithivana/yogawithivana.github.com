<p>"If I throw a stone into the window it will break" - my teacher would say. "But if I throw the same stone into the wall the wall won't break, the stone will just bounce off. It's not the stone that breaks the window, it's the fragility of the glass that breaks it."</p>

<p>Explained through the metaphor of the window, yoga would be a practice of making your glass flexible enough to resist breaking. Through various physical and mental exercises we learn how to maintain balance as everything around us keeps moving and changing and be undisturbed by stones that will inevitably fall into our window.</p>
