<p>"If I throw a stone into the window it will break" - my teacher would say. "However, if I throw the same stone into the wall the wall won't break, the stone will just bounce off. It's not the stone that breaks the window, it's the fragility of the glass that breaks it."</p>

<p>Explained through the metaphor of the window, yoga would be a practice of strengthening and upgrading your glass. Through various physical and mental exercises we gradually cultivate balance as everything around us constantly moves and changes, not being easily shaken by stones that will inevitably fall into our window.</p>
