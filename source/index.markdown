<p>The fast-paced life in big cities leaves imprint on our bodies. Not even aware of the tension that we carry around in our muscles, we use the bodies less and less. The range of movement gradually decreases and muscles shorten. Practicing yoga can reverse this process, helping us learn how to use our bodies to their full capacity, setting them free of tension that we've accumulated over years. And freeing the body, reviving its suppleness we are making a step closer towards freeing the mind. </p>

<p>Yoga helps us to reconnect with the body, the breath, the powerful force of nature breathing through our bodies, finding a sense of wholeness. We learn how to be present, to observe and listen patiently to whatever lies within us and to be able to embrace it.</p>
