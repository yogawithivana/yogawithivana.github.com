<p>The fast-paced life leaves an imprint on our bodies. Not even aware of the tension that we carry around in our muscles, we use the bodies less and less. The range of movement gradually decreases and muscles shorten. Practicing yoga can reverse this process, setting us free of tension that weâ€™ve accumulated over years.</p>

<p>Yoga makes us move from thinking into being. We learn how to release thoughts, bring the mind to the present moment and simply breath and move. Cultivating the ability to relax into the intensity of poses, we become able to relax into stressful situations of life instead of getting caught up in the fight-or-flight response. And gradually this peaceful relaxed state of mind becomes the way we are.</p>
