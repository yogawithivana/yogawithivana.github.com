<p>Teaching yoga for me means inspiring and empowering, helping a student discover the inner grace and the calm strength within him/herself. I find it important to approach every student as unique as they are. I track students' progress and plan the classes carefully having in mind each student's specific needs and abilities and their pace of changing.</p>

<p>Recently my main focus has been pregnancy yoga, please check the group class page for more info. I also have some hands-on experience in using yoga in weight management and management of various chronic health conditions and sport injuries, working with people with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, respiratory and orthopedic problems.</p>
