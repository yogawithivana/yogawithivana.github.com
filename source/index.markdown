Teaching yoga for me means inspiring and empowering, helping a student discover his inner strength and always move his limits a bit further. Through teaching I would like to share my passion for silence and beauty of movement, inspiring my students to revive the connection with their body and nurture the peace within.

Yoga has helped me break out of a wrong career path as a lawyer, releasing and embracing my creative self. Through yoga I have discovered myself as an artist and traveller, brave and full of energy, living in a moment. I've discovered humility and gratitude towards the world and the beauty of being a tiny part in a larger process of life. Sharing my knowledge and passion is my way to express this gratitude.
